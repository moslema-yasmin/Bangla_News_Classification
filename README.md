# Bengali Document Classfication Overview
* Created a tool that can categorizes the Bengali news articles into 5 diffferent class (Economics', 'Entertainment', 'International', 'Science and Technology', 'Sports') using Machine Learning.
* A publicly available dataset of 500 news articles is used to develop the system. The dataset consist 5 different categories news articles.
* Naive Bayes Classifier and SVM(Support Vector Machine) are used for Machine Learning
* The model performance is evaluated using various evaluation measures such as confusion matrix, accuracy , precision, recall and f1-score.
# Resources Used
* Developement Envioronment : Spyder
* Python Version : 3.8
* Packages : Tensorflow 2.6.0, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
# How to run
> Download the .py and .csv files and please them into a same folder and run the .py file using IDE(Spyder or else)
# Challenge and Threat
* TensorFlow Module didn't default install in Anaconda. We try to automatically install it from the python script. But it can faild. Then to install namually by using this command in Spyder console !pip3 install tensorflow
